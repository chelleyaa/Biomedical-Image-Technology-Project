# Biomedical-Image-Technology-Project
A MATLAB-based project that leverages the AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify stages of Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans. This project aims to provide a robust tool for supporting early diagnosis and disease progression assessment.

# About The Project
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by subtle changes in brain structure. This project utilizes the power of deep learning, specifically the well-established AlexNet architecture, to automatically identify these patterns from brain MRI images.

Developed entirely in the MATLAB environment, the program preprocesses raw MRI data and uses a fine-tuned AlexNet model to classify images into four distinct categories, providing a quantitative basis for clinical assessment. The goal is to create a system that can aid medical professionals in the early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease.

Of course. Here is the complete README in English, updated to specifically mention the use of the AlexNet architecture.

About The Project
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by subtle changes in brain structure. This project utilizes the power of deep learning, specifically the well-established AlexNet architecture, to automatically identify these patterns from brain MRI images.

The goal is to create a system that can aid medical professionals in the early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease.

Classification Categories
The model is trained to differentiate between four stages of cognitive health  based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale:
1. Normal (Non-demented) = 0
2. Very Mild Dementia = 0.5
3. Mild Dementia = 1
4. Moderate Dementia = 2

# Key Features
1. Proven Deep Learning Architecture: Employs the AlexNet CNN for end-to-end image classification.
2. End-to-End MATLAB Implementation: The entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, is built using MATLAB and its specialized toolboxes.
3. Multi-Class Classification: Differentiates between four clinically relevant stages of Alzheimer's disease.
4. Standardized Dataset: Built upon the publicly available and widely recognized OASIS brain MRI dataset.
5. Transfer Learning: Utilizes a pre-trained AlexNet model to leverage learned features, improving training efficiency and performance.

# Dataset
-Name: Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)
-Description: The project utilizes a cross-sectional MRI dataset from OASIS. This collection includes scans from 416 individuals aged 18 to 96.
-Cohort: A key subset of the data includes 100 individuals aged 60-96 with clinically diagnosed, very mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
